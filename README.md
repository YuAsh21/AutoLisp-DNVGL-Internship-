The program was developed using "AutoLISP" as the programming language. I had no prior experience with both the software AutoCAD and the language AutoLISP.
Consequently, a considerable amount of time was dedicated to learning how to use the software and how to program in AutoLISP.
Learning efforts included studying the developerâ€™s guide on AutoLISP and other relevant materials, as well as engaging with online resources such as forums, 
YouTube videos, and tutorials.
During the internship period, two versions of the desired program, "StructTagger," were created. Additionally, my supervisor suggested creating an additional program
to aid in structural drawings, named "gridlines," to assist in drawing the grid-lines. The objective behind developing StructTagger was to streamline and simplify 
work processes. Discussions with my supervisor revolved around strategies to achieve this goal.
After extensive deliberation, it was agreed that allowing users to click on text within the gridlines and elevation numbers would resolve the issue.
The program was designed to prompt users to select text strings to be included in the tag. The selected text strings were automatically converted into a concatenated
string separated by dashes, representing a typical tag style. Upon completion of text selection, users could right-click to signal the completion of the tag and
choose a location for placing it.
